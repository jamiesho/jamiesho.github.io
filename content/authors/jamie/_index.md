Jamie Shotton is a leader in AI technology research and development.  He is Partner Director of Science at Microsoft and heads the [Mixed Reality & AI Labs](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/mixed-reality-ai-lab-cambridge/) in Cambridge, Zurich, and Belgrade.  His team incubates transformative new technologies and experiences from early stage research to shipping product.  His research focuses at the intersection of computer vision, AI, machine learning, and graphics, with particular emphasis on systems that understand the motion, shape, and appearance of people in 3D.  He has explored applications of this work for mixed reality, virtual presence, human-computer interaction, gaming, robotics, and healthcare.  He has shipped foundational features in multiple products including body tracking for Kinect and the hand- and eye-tracking that enable HoloLens 2’s instinctual interaction model.

He has received multiple Best Paper and Best Demo awards at top-tier academic conferences, and the [Longuet-Higgins Prize](https://www.thecvf.com/?page_id=534) test-of-time award at CVPR 2021. His work on Kinect was awarded the Royal Academy of Engineering’s gold medal [MacRobert Award](https://www.raeng.org.uk/news/news-releases/2011/June/cambridge-engineers-kinect-land-uk-prize) in 2011, and he shares Microsoft’s Outstanding Technical Achievement Award for 2012 with the Kinect engineering team. In 2014 he received the [PAMI Young Researcher Award](https://tc.computer.org/tcpami/young-researcher-award/), and in 2015 the MIT Technology Review [Innovator Under 35 Award](https://www.technologyreview.com/lists/innovators-under-35/2015/).  He was awarded the Royal Academy of Engineering's [Silver Medal](https://www.raeng.org.uk/grants-prizes/prizes/prizes-and-medals/individual-medals/silver-medal) in 2020.
